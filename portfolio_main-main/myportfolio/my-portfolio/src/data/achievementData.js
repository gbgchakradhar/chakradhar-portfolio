  bio: "I started my undergraduate days without having any clue about CSE. I am not good at communication skills, not good at Coding, and not interactive in club activities. But, After completion of my first year, I realized that I should change the approach to improving my technical and communication skills. I started Learning Web Development skills and started applying for Internships. Then, at the beginning of the third year, I started taking leadership roles in club activities which helped me to improve my communication skills and technical knowledge.",
